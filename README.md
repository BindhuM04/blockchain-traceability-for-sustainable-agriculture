# blockchain-traceability-for-sustainable-agriculture
This project proposes a blockchain-based system with QR code integration to secure the agricultural food supply chain. It ensures end-to-end traceability, data immutability, and real-time product authentication. The system enhances trust and efficiency by preventing fraud and enabling easy consumer verification.
